# NYC Rodent Inspection Prediction

### Presentation Time Limit: 4 minutes
The time constraints are purposefully kept short to force us to deliver our results in a clear and consise manner that can be digested by an audience of varying technical acumen.

The slide deck is not meant to by any means comprehnsively detail the substantial amount of analysis, coding, and modeling that went into the project.

### Objective: 
Using NYC rodent inspection results data from the NYC Open Data portal, build a model that will predict whether a given property will pass or fail. 

Incorporate near by restaurant inspection data as well to see if it adds any predictive power i.e. if a property is near a restaurant that has failed inspection due to a rodent problem, will that impact the likelihood of the property itself passing?

### Data:
NYC Rodent Inspection Results
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj

NYC Restaurant Inspection Results
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j   

Approx. 1.3 million rows of data between both data sets.

### Code:
All coding was done in a Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab.
