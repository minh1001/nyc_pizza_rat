# NYC Rodent Inspection Prediction

### Objective: 
Using NYC rodent inspection results data from the NYC Open Data portal, build a model that will predict whether a given property will pass or fail. Incorporate near by restaurant inspection data as well to see if they add any predictive power i.e. if a property is near a restaurant(s) that has failed inspection due to a rodent problem, will that impact the likelihood of the property itself passing?
